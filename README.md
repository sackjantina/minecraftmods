# Connecting to my Minecraft Server

***

## Step 1: Install Minecraft Forge

To start off you need to install a different version of minecraft called Forge. You can install it by running the file: ***forge-1.12.2-14.23.4.2703-installer.jar***.  Then the next time you open up the Minecraft Launcher, you will need to select *forge* as the version you want to play.
Note: In order to run the file, you **must** have java installed on your computer as the installer is a jar file.

## Step 2: Install the Mods

After downloading each of the mods in this file, you will need to place them in a special folder on your computer. To get there, type in %appdata% into the address bar of your file explorer. If for whatever reason that didn't work, the absolute path is C:\Users\\$your username$\AppData\Roaming\\.minecraft. Then open the mods folder or make one if it doesn't exist and paste all the mods here. Currently the mods that I have installed are:

1. grapplemod-v.11.1-1.12.2.jar
2. lostcities-1.12-2.0.22.jar
3. mw_2.0-0.4.4.6_mc1.12.2.jar
4. OptiFine_1.12.2_HD_U_F5.jar
5. thiccentities-1.4.jar

## Step 3: Install Resource & Shader Packs

There are several .zip files that you should have downloaded as well. These are resourcepacks and shaderpacks and should be pasted into the corresponding folder within the same .minecraft folder from the previous step

## Step 4: Connect to the Server

Once you start up the Forge version of Minecraft, go to multiplayer and add a new server. At the time of writing this, the address of the server is ********************. Type that in and hopefully the server is online and you can connect.

## Step 5: Configure Shaders and add Resource Packs

After you connect to the server, you should go into Settings>Options>Resource Packs and Tissou's Zombie Pack to the Selected Resource Packs. This will make the Zombies look much "scarier" rather than having the token minecraft look. They will also moan and groan more "zombie like". Then go into Settings>Video Settings>Shaders and select Chocapic13_V8_Ultra.zip. Your screen will freeze for a second as it is loading. Once its done go into Shader Options>Atmospherics>Fog_Densities and increase the Atmospheric_Density to 5.0

## Step 6: Play
